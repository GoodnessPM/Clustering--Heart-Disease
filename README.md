Clustering is a unsupervised learning algorithm that automatically organizes data into groups. It's unsupervised because the algorithm figures out the groups on its own, without any pre-defined categories. This is useful for finding hidden patterns in data, like grouping customers with similar shopping habits or in this case grouping patients with similar diagnosis.

Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease (CVD), is an umbrella term for conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. This includes coronary artery disease, heart attacks, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Early diagnosis is critical. It allows for prompt treatment, which can significantly reduce the risk of complications like heart attacks and improve overall health outcomes. Identifying risk factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and unhealthy lifestyle habits early is key. This allows for timely intervention through lifestyle changes and medications. Regular check-ups and being aware of potential symptoms are crucial for early detection, leading to better management of the disease and a better quality of life for those affected.

Dataset
The data used for this learning was obtained from V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, California, publicly available on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/k-means-clustering-for-heart-disease-analysis. The objective was to examine patients and cluster for heart disease diagnosis
